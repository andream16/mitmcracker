ENCRYPT E DECRYPT USAGE
=======================

The encrypt program takes as input a plain text and returns as output 
the corresponding ciphertext. Syntax:

	$ ./encrypt key filename        OR
  $ ./encrypt -s key plaintext    	

The key must necessarily be composed by 5, 6, 7 or 8 hexadecimal uppercase digits
(ie composed by 20, 24, 28 or 32 bit). More precisely, the program always uses 32 bit
keys, but accepts shorter keys by extending them with zeros. Example:

	- Key: ABCABC (24-bit) --- becomes ---> 00ABCABC (32-bit)

IMPORTANT: this is a special-purpose version of this software, in which ONLY
16-length hexadecimal inputs are allowed (64-bit blocks). 
Moreover, the padding step is disabled.
